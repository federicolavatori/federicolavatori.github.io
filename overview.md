Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name  is Federico and I am currently working as a data scientist and data engineer at [Hype](https://www.hype.it/) with a particular focus on product innovation

A keen interest in product management, ownership and strategy has recently pervaded me and I guess it's here to stay.

Hit me up for collabs, job opportunities or if you just want to have a follow-up discussion on posts and frameworks I discussed here
