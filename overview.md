My name  is Federico and I am currently working as a data scientist and data engineer at [Hype](https://www.hype.it/) 💥

A keen interest in product management has recently pervaded me and I guess it's here to stay 💡

Hit me up for collabs, job opportunities or if you just want to have a follow-up discussion on posts and frameworks I discussed here 🤝
