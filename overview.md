I'm Federico, a versatile professional who's been diving into different roles, using data to build digital products that create impact.

Recently, I discovered a passion for writing as a form of knowledge sharing and self-understanding. You can find some content [here](https://federicolavatori.com/content/)

Events planning and community building energize me so much that I often lose track of the operational complexities involved.

I try not to treat sustainability as a buzzword: fighting food waste is a core non-negotiable value deeply rooted in my DNA. Checkout what we do at [Recup](https://associazionerecup.org/) and [Taste Before You Waste](https://www.tastebeforeyouwaste.org/)
