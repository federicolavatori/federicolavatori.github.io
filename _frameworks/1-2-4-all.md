The idea of 1-2-4-all is that you continue to build up from individual reflection into group reflection until you collectively discuss the highlights. You choose a particular topic, issue or idea on which you reflect as an individual. Then you discuss in pairs, after which you discuss it in groups of 4. After this, you will come together with the entire group and each group will share the highlights in plenary. You can find more about it in [this blogpost](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/)
